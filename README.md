# Chatbot Using NLP and Logistic Regression

This project is a **Chatbot** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Logistic Regression** for intent classification. The chatbot is designed to interact with users and provide responses based on predefined patterns. It also features a **Streamlit interface** for easy interaction.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engages in conversation with users by recognizing intents based on predefined patterns.
- **Green and Black Theme**: The chatbot interface uses a visually appealing **green and black color scheme**.
- **Chatbot with Robot Icon**: Includes a fun **robot icon** beside the chatbot responses for a more engaging experience.
- **Sidebar Menu**: The left sidebar contains useful navigation options like **Home**, **History**, **New Chat**, and **About**.
- **Background Image**: A **background image** enhances the visual appeal of the chatbot interface.
- **Fixed Chatbox**: The chatbox stays at the **bottom** of the screen for easy access during interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for implementing the chatbot.
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive web interface.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To process and understand user input.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used as the classifier for identifying the userâ€™s intent.
- **Scikit-learn**: For the NLP vectorization and machine learning model.
- **Pandas and CSV**: For storing conversation history.
- **nltk**: For tokenizing and processing user input.
